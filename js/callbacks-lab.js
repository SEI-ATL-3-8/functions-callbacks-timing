// 1.
// Write a simple greeting function that just prints "Hello!" and save it to a variable. Schedule it to run one time, 5 seconds from now.

// 2.
// Schedule that same greeting function to run once every one-and-a-half seconds

// 3.
// Cancel the one-time execution from question 1. (If done correctly, you will never see it print.) Note that to do this, you have to assign the return value of setTimeout to a variable.

// 4. Cancel the recurring print from question 2. (If done correctly, you will never see it print.) Note that to do this, you have to assign the return value of setInterval to a variable.
