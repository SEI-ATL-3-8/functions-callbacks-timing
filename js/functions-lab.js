// 1.
// Write a function that prints the title of your favorite movie. Save it to a variable called printFavoriteMovie

// 2.
// Write a function that prints the numbers between 1 and 5 (inclusive), each on their own line. (You could hardcode 5 print statements, but wouldn't it be nicer to use a for loop?) Save it to a variable called countToFive. Then invoke it.

// 3.
// Declare a variable (outside of any function) called isHavingFun, and give it a boolean value. Then write a function called funOrNoFun, that prints an upbeat and exciting message if isHavingFun is true, and a real bummer message if isHavingFun is false.

// 4.
// Write a function called sayHelloTo that takes a string as a parameter. It should print out "Why hello there, <name>!", where <name> is the value of the name parameter. Invoke this function a few times, with a different name each time

// 3. 
// write a function that accepts a number as a parameter, squares it (multiplies it by itself), and prints the result. Invoke it with a few different numbers to see some differing results

// 6. 
// Write a function called concatenateNumbers that accepts two integers as parameters, converts the two integers to strings and concatenates them, and print the result
// example input: 5, 4
// output: "54"
// example input: 67, 1
// output: "671"


// 7. 
// write a function called findLarger that accepts two numbers as parameters, compares them and returns the number that is larger
// invoke the function and assign its return to a new variable
// print the variable
// example input: 3, 15
// output: 15


// 8. write a function called addExcitement that accepts a string as a parameter. It should return a version of that string that is all uppercase, and has 3 exclamation points on the end. Invoke this function, save the result as a variable, and print the variable.

// 9. 
// write a function called findMax that accepts an array of numbers as a parameter, loops over the array, finds the largest of all the values in the array and returns it
// invoke the function and assign its return to a new variable
// print the variable
